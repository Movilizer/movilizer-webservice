/**
 * This is <tt>Future</tt> mimics the behavior and API of Scala Futures for easier integration Scala since Java Futures
 * are blocking... This interface is intended to be use to create anonymous classes when async methods are to be used.
 * See the following example:
 * <p/>
 * Async method call:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * final Persistence service = new Persistence();
 * myAsyncCalculation("http://path.to/rest/integer/resource", new FutureCallback<Integer> {
 *     void onSuccess(Integer myExternalNumber){
 *         service.save(2 + myExternalNumber);
 *     }
 *     void onComplete(Integer myExternalNumber, Exception futureException) {}
 *     void onFailure(Exception futureException) {}
 * });
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Async method implementation:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * void myAsyncCalculation(String resourceURI, FutureCallback<Integer> myFuture) {
 *      //Omitted async call to get the resource
 *      try {
 *          Integer externalNumber = get(resourceURI);
 *          myFuture.onSuccess(externalNumber);  //FIRST CALL SUCCESS
 *          myFuture.onComplete(externalNumber, null);  //onComplete IS CALLED LAST
 *      } catch (Exception e) {
 *          myFuture.onFailure(e);
 *          myFuture.onComplete(null, e);  //onComplete IS CALLED LAST
 *      }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Notice the following behaviour. On future completion, either <tt>onSuccess</tt> or
 * <tt>onFailure</tt> will be called once and then, independently of the result of the future, the onComplete will be
 * called. <b>THIS BEHAVIOUR MUST BE FOLLOWED WHEN IMPLEMENTING FUNCTIONS THAT RESOLVE THE GIVEN FUTURES</b>.
 * <p/>
 * For extra information on Futures and Scala Futures see:
 * <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html">Futures and Promises</a>
 *
 * @param <T> The future instance of the variable we want to work with.
